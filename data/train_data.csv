"In physics, Whitehead's ideas have had some influence. He expressed a view that might perhaps be considered a form of Einstein's general relativity, see Whitehead's theory of gravitation. This has been seriously criticized. Yutaka Tanaka, who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings, proposes that Einstein's work does not actually refute Whitehead's formulation. Whitehead's view has now been rendered obsolete with the discovery of gravitational waves. Those phenomena have been observed locally that violate the local flatness of large-scale space that Whitehead assumes. As a result, Whitehead's universe should be treated as a local conjecture, and his notion of a similar spatio-temporal geometry, the Minkoloskian, should often be treated as a locally-sufficient conjecture. An accurate replacement of Whitehead's cosmology would require accepting Riemannian geometry. Furthermore, although Whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory, the metaphysics of processes has proven attractive to some physicists in that field. Henry Stapp and David Boehm are among those whose work has been influenced by Whitehead.",What effect did the discovery of gravitational waves have on Whitehead's theory?,Whitehead's view is now rendered obsolete with the discovery of gravitational waves.,12,96

"Armenian literature dates back to 400 AD, when Mesop Mashtots invented the first Armenian alphabet. This period is often seen as the Golden Age of Armenian literature. Early Armenian literature was written by the ""Father of Armenian History"", Moses of Korin, who wrote a history of Armenia. The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD. There is a great literary movement in the nineteenth century which was to give rise to modern Armenian literature. This period of time, during which Armenian culture flourished, is known as the Revival Period (Zartanki Sherchan). The revivalist writers of Constantinople and Tiflis, almost identical to the Romantics of Europe, were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism. Most of them adopted newly created Eastern or Western forms of the Armenian language, depending on the target audience, and preferred them over Classical Armenian (Grabar). This period ended after the Hamidian Genocide, when the Armenians experienced turbulent times.

Schoenberg believes that Chopin displayed ""jealousy and chauvinistic inclinations"" toward Liszt's virtuosity at the piano, and others have also argued that he was charmed with Liszt's theatricality, exploits, and success.

Some commentators point to events in the romantic lives of the two men as causing a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe That Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand.",Did Chopin write his music to demonstrate his desire to get artists to play it?,hiller,498,504

"Since Whitehead's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities have experience, he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living, self-aware beings. The word he coined was ""prehension"", which comes from the Latin prehensio, meaning ""to seize."" The word is meant to indicate a kind of perception that is conscious for people as well as electrons. Or may become unconscious. It is also clearly intended to reject Whitehead's theory of representational perception, in which the mind has only private thoughts about other entities. For Whitehead, the term ""prehension"" indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself. In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them. Furthermore, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, causal efficacy (or ""physical prehencion"") and presentation immediacy (or ""conceptual prehencion"").","What is the origin of the word ""prehension""?","Comes from Latin prehenio, meaning ""to seize",261,305

In addition to the rise of Prussia, Augustus III, although ineffective, could muster an army from not only Saxony, but also Poland as he was king of Poland. Bavaria's growing power and independence were also evident as it had more of a voice in the path that its army should take, and managed to stay out of the war.

"However, during this period, prominent figures and artists in the scene began to lean away from underground aesthetics. In the music press, the increasingly esoteric writing of post-punk publications soon began to alienate their readers; it has been estimated that over several years, NME suffered the loss of half its circulation. Writers such as Paul Morley began to advocate ""overground brightness"" rather than the experimental sensibilities promoted in the early years. Morley's own musical collaborations with engineer Gary Langan and programmer J. Jeczalik would attempt to bring the art of noise, sampling and electronic sounds into the pop mainstream. A variety of pop-oriented groups, including ABC, the Associates, Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow (the latter two managed by former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm MacLaren) emerged with the development of the New Romantic subculture scene. Emphasizing glamour, fashion, and escapism in contrast to the experimental seriousness of earlier post-punk groups, the club-oriented scene drew some skepticism from denizens of the movement.","Did the author advocate ""overground brightness""?",Paul Morley,348,359

"Antibiotics are tested for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use, and are generally considered safe and most well tolerated. However, some antibiotics are associated with a range of adverse side effects. Side effects range from mild to very severe depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacologic or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or include hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. The safety profile of new drugs is often not established even for those with a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side effects include diarrhea, resulting from a disruption in the species composition of the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibiotics can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area.

"Antibiotics are tested for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use, and are generally considered safe and most well tolerated. However, some antibiotics are associated with a range of adverse side effects. Side effects range from mild to very severe depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacologic or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or include hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. The safety profile of new drugs is often not established even for those with a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side effects include diarrhea, resulting from a disruption in the species composition of the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibiotics can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side effects may result from interactions with other drugs, such as increased risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid.

"Exposure to antibiotics early in life increases body mass in humans and mouse models. Early life is a critical period for the establishment of the intestinal microbiota and metabolic development. Mice exposed to the above antibiotic treatments (STAT) – either penicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and vancomycin, or chlortetracycline had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities. Additionally, research has shown that rats given low dose penicillin (1 μg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the lactation process had decreased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis. Expression was increased in control rats. Furthermore, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet rapidly increased insulin levels in rats. However, it is unclear whether antibiotics cause obesity in humans. Studies have found a correlation between early exposure to antibiotics (<6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months). Another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also important, with those macrolides having the highest risk of overweight compared to penicillins and cephalosporins. Therefore, there is an association between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans, but whether there is a causal relationship is unclear. Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans must weigh against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in childhood.",Do antibiotics increase the chance for humans to get fat?,unclear,832,839

These include host defense mechanisms, site of infection, and the biochemical and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial. The bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth stage, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells. These findings are based on laboratory studies, and have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infections in clinical settings. Since the activity of an antibacterial often depends on its concentration, in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity usually involves determining the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial.

"Biodiversity, a contraction of ""biological diversity"", generally refers to the diversity and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of variability within species, between species, and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the diversity of organisms present in different ecosystems. It may refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within a region, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which appears to be a result of the warmer climate and higher primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is the richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity is highest along the coasts in the western Pacific, where sea surface temperatures are highest and in mid-latitude bands of all oceans.

"Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar, and have been transferred to antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during evolution and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For example, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged through these resistance genes between different bacterial strains or species. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer multiple antibacterial resistance. Cross-resistance to multiple antibacterials can also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene confers resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.",What meets some resistance?,change,22,28

Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in the treatment of infections were described 2000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected molds and plant materials and extracted extracts to treat infections. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis among microorganisms initiated the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, ""If we could interfere with the rivalry observed between certain bacteria, it would perhaps offer the greatest hopes for therapeutics"". The term 'antibiosis', meaning ""against life"", was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Villemin as a descriptive name for the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that antibiosis was first described in bacteria in 1877, when an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis. These drugs were later named antibiotics by Selman Waksman, an American microbiologist in 1942. The science and development of antibacterials as synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. Ehrlich noted that some dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, while others did not.

""Mark's hair has turned gray because he He's grown older, but he's still the same person""). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existing things are separate ""occasions of experience"" that overlap each other in time and space, and jointly make up an enduring person or thing. On the other hand, common thinking often treats ""the essence of something"" or ""a person's identity/core"" as the most important or salient characteristics of that person or thing at a given time. One of its essence is generalization. Identities don't define people, people define identities. Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having a ""permanent essence"" misses the fact that ""all things flow"", although this is often a useful way of speaking.","Regarding the idea that persons or objects do not fundamentally change, what terms can be used to describe what the object or person actually is?","""Defining essence"" or ""core identity""",76,113

"From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could model all of physics in terms of the extent of the coupling of those particles' spins and fundamental forces. Feynman attempted to explain the strong interactions governing nuclei called the partner model. The Parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was unclear; Gell-Mann presented Feynman's parton as a ""put-on"". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as in the figure of the omega-minus particle, if it was interpreted as three identical strange quarks. , so it seemed impossible if quarks were real. Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments in the late 1960s showed, similarly to the 1911 experiment on scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) scattered electrons as point-like particles. implied. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to explain the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy motion was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleus. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be gluons that carry the forces between quarks and also carry the three-valued color quantum number that solves the omega-minus problem.

"In physics, Whitehead's ideas have had some influence. He expressed a view that might perhaps be considered a form of Einstein's general relativity, see Whitehead's theory of gravitation. This has been seriously criticized. Yutaka Tanaka, who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings, proposes that Einstein's work does not actually refute Whitehead's formulation. Whitehead's view has now been rendered obsolete with the discovery of gravitational waves. Those phenomena have been observed locally that violate the local flatness of large-scale space that Whitehead assumes. As a result, Whitehead's universe should be treated as a local conjecture, and his notion of a similar spatio-temporal geometry, the Minkoloskian, should often be treated as a locally-sufficient conjecture. An accurate replacement of Whitehead's cosmology would require accepting Riemannian geometry. Furthermore, although Whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory, the metaphysics of processes has proven attractive to some physicists in that field.

"In Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as ""quality"", ""matter"", and ""form"" are problematic. These fail to adequately account for change in ""classical"" concepts, and ignore the active and experiential nature of the world's most basic elements. They are useful abstractions, but not the basic building blocks of the world. What a person is usually conceived of, for example, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events. After all, people change all the time, if only because they are older than the second and have had some more experiences. These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but progressively linked in what Whitehead calls a ""society"" of events.

"On the other hand, the change through the Phanerozoic fits much better with hyperbolic models (widely used in population biology, demography and macrosociology, as well as fossil biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter model implies that changes in diversity are guided by first order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or negative feedback resulting from resource limitation. The hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of world population growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between population size and the rate of technological progress. The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be equated to the feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between biodiversity and human population curves probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics.",Does the model imply a second order positive feedback?,hyperbolic model,76,92

"Mahayana Buddhism received important theoretical grounding from Nagarjuna (probably c. 150–250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahayana tradition. Nāgārjuna's primary contribution to Buddhist philosophy was the systematic exposition of the concept of śśnyatā, or ""emptiness"", which was widely attested in the Prajñapāmita sutras that emerged in his era. The concept of emptiness brings together a rejection of other major Buddhist doctrines, particularly anatta and dependent origination, the metaphysics of Sarvottvāda and Sautrantika (extinct non-Mahayana school). For Nāgārjuna, it is not only sentient beings that are empty of āman; all phenomena (dharma) are without any sentient (literally ""self-nature"" or ""self-nature""), and thus without any inherent of essence; they are ""empty"" of independent being; thus the heterodox doctrines of the self circulating in time were rejected based on the principles of early Buddhism. Nagarjuna's school of thought is known as Dadhamaka. Some writings attributed to Nāgārjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts, but argued his philosophy within the parameters set by the Agamas. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the canon.

"To put it another way, a thing or person is often seen as having a ""defined essence"" or ""core identity"" that is immutable, and describes what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally identical over time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e. ""Mark's hair has turned gray because he He's grown older, but he's still the same person""). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existing things are separate ""occasions of experience"" that overlap each other in time and space, and jointly make up an enduring person or thing. On the other hand, common thinking often treats ""the essence of something"" or ""a person's identity/core"" as the most important or salient characteristics of that person or thing at a given time. One of its essence is generalization. Identities don't define people, people define identities. Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having a ""permanent essence"" misses the fact that ""all things flow"", although this is often a useful way of speaking.","In Whitehead's cosmology, what are the fundamentally existing things?",Experience Opportunities,527,551

"The different stages of digestion include: cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought, and smell of food, which stimulates the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. It is then routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine occurs. In this phase gastric secretion increases to 40% of the maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secreted acid) and G cell (secreted gastrin) activity through D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by gastric distention, presence of food in the stomach, and decreased pH. Distension activates the long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As the protein enters the stomach, it binds with hydrogen ions, which increases the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is raised. This triggers the G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates the parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is approximately 0. 5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine. The intestinal phase consists of two parts, stimulatory and inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers the intestines to release gastrin. The enterogastric reflex inhibits the vagus nucleus, activates sympathetic fibers thereby forcing the pyloric sphincter to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.",How is the gastric phase stimulated to begin?,"Stomach distension, presence of food in the stomach and decrease in pH",748,818

However, some antibiotics are associated with a range of adverse side effects. Side effects range from mild to very severe depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacologic or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or include hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. The safety profile of new drugs is often not established even for those with a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side effects include diarrhea, resulting from a disruption in the species composition of the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibiotics can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area.

The Prussians then occupied Saxony; after the siege of Pirna, the Saxon army surrendered in October 1756, and they were forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army. The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition. The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia.

"Phage therapy is another option being looked at to treat resistant strains of bacteria. The way researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are virulent bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterial lytic cycles. By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacteria, phages destroy their metabolism, which ultimately results in cell death. The phages will insert their DNA into the bacteria, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA has been transferred the cell will proceed to form new phages and as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse. One of the concerns with using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect ""good"" bacteria, or bacteria that are important in humans' everyday function. However, studies have proven that the phages are very specific when they target bacteria, which leads researchers to believe that sterile therapy is the surest path to defeat antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",What has been talked about to treat resistant bacteria?,phage therapy,0,13

"However, it should be stressed that for Whitehead God is not tied to religion. Rather than springing primarily from religious faith, Whitehead saw God as essential to his spiritual system. His system required that there exist an order among the possibilities, an order that permitted novelty in the world and provided a purpose to all entities. Whitehead said that these ordered capacities exist in what he called God's primitive nature. However, Whitehead was also interested in religious experience. This led him to reflect more intensely on what he saw as God's second nature, the consequential nature.

"Exposure to antibiotics early in life increases body mass in humans and mouse models. Early life is a critical period for the establishment of the intestinal microbiota and metabolic development. Mice exposed to the above antibiotic treatments (STAT) – either penicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and vancomycin, or chlortetracycline had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities. Additionally, research has shown that rats given low dose penicillin (1 μg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the lactation process had decreased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis. Expression was increased in control rats. Furthermore, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet rapidly increased insulin levels in rats. However, it is unclear whether antibiotics cause obesity in humans. Studies have found a correlation between early exposure to antibiotics (<6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months). Another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also important, with those macrolides having the highest risk of overweight compared to penicillins and cephalosporins. Therefore, there is an association between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans, but whether there is a causal relationship is unclear. Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans must weigh against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in childhood.",When does the intestinal microbiota develop?,early life,24,34

"From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could model all of physics in terms of the extent of the coupling of those particles' spins and fundamental forces. Feynman attempted to explain the strong interactions governing nuclei called the partner model. The Parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was unclear; Gell-Mann presented Feynman's parton as a ""put-on"". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as in the figure of the omega-minus particle, if it was interpreted as three identical strange quarks. , so it seemed impossible if quarks were real. Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments in the late 1960s showed, similarly to the 1911 experiment on scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) scattered electrons as point-like particles. implied. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to explain the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy motion was carried by electrically-neutral particles in the nucleus. These electrically-neutral particles are now seen to be gluons that carry the forces between quarks and also carry the three-valued color quantum number that solves the omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately told his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, discovered in the decade after his death.

"All of Chopin's compositions involve piano. Most are for solo piano, although he also wrote two piano concertos, some chamber pieces, and some ballads for polish. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their perceptiveness and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of the instrumental ballad. His major piano works also include Mazurkas, Waltzes, Nocturnes, Polonaises, Études, Impromptus, Scherzos, Predudes and Sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his creative style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, all of whose music he admired, as well as the Paris Salon where he was a frequent guest.

During this period, the people of the counties of Portugal styled themselves as Galicians, struggling to maintain the autonomy of Galicia with its distinct language and culture (Galician-Portuguese) from the Lyonnais culture, even when the Kingdom of Galicia was divided. The situation changed in relation to the Kingdom of Lyon.

"The different stages of digestion include: cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought, and smell of food, which stimulates the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. It is then routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine occurs. In this phase gastric secretion increases to 40% of the maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secreted acid) and G cell (secreted gastrin) activity through D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by gastric distention, presence of food in the stomach, and decreased pH. Distension activates the long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As the protein enters the stomach, it binds with hydrogen ions, which increases the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is raised. This triggers the G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates the parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is approximately 0. 5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine. The intestinal phase consists of two parts, stimulatory and inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers the intestines to release gastrin. The enterogastric reflex inhibits the vagus nucleus, activates sympathetic fibers thereby forcing the pyloric sphincter to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.",How long does the gastric phase take?,3 to 4 hours,235,247

After the festival, the trio visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn was appointed music director. He spent what Mendelssohn described as ""a very agreeable day"", playing and discussing music at his piano, and meeting Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his distinguished pupils such as Low, Bendmann, Met Hildebrand and Sohn.

Lending to AA rated sovereigns has a risk-weight of zero, thus leading to lending to governments and the next crisis.

"Flory and Chen succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, penicillin G, in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied forces until 1945. Later, Norman Heatley developed back extraction techniques to efficiently purify penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crofoot Hodgin in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not blocked by biological components such as PUL, unlike synthetic sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety. For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming accidentally discovered but could not develop as a therapeutic drug himself, Ernst Chain and Howard Florwei shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming.

"The different stages of digestion include: cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought, and smell of food, which stimulates the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. It is then routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine occurs. In this phase gastric secretion increases to 40% of the maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secreted acid) and G cell (secreted gastrin) activity through D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by gastric distention, presence of food in the stomach, and decreased pH. Distension activates the long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As the protein enters the stomach, it binds with hydrogen ions, which increases the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is raised. This triggers the G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates the parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is approximately 0. 5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine. The intestinal phase consists of two parts, stimulatory and inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers the intestines to release gastrin. The enterogastric reflex inhibits the vagus nucleus, activates sympathetic fibers thereby forcing the pyloric sphincter to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.",What are the three digestive stages?,"Cephalic stage, gastric stage, and intestinal stage",43,94

"However, during this period, prominent figures and artists in the scene began to lean away from underground aesthetics. In the music press, the increasingly esoteric writing of post-punk publications soon began to alienate their readers; it has been estimated that over several years, NME suffered the loss of half its circulation. Writers such as Paul Morley began to advocate ""overground brightness"" rather than the experimental sensibilities promoted in the early years.

"The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on many factors. These include host defense mechanisms, site of infection, and the biochemical and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial. The bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth stage, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells. These findings are based on laboratory studies, and have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infections in clinical settings. Since the activity of an antibacterial often depends on its concentration, in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity usually involves determining the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial. To predict clinical outcome, the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its Pharmacokinetic profile, and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy.",What does the activity of antibacterial depend on?,concentration,590,603

""Mark's hair has turned gray because he He's grown older, but he's still the same person""). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existing things are separate ""occasions of experience"" that overlap each other in time and space, and jointly make up an enduring person or thing.

"Before the beginning of the 20th century, treatments for infections were primarily based on medicinal folklore. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in the treatment of infections were described 2000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected molds and plant materials and extracted extracts to treat infections. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis among microorganisms initiated the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, ""If we could interfere with the rivalry observed between certain bacteria, it would perhaps offer the greatest hopes for therapeutics"". The term 'antibiosis', meaning ""against life"", was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Villemin as a descriptive name for the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that antibiosis was first described in bacteria in 1877, when an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis. These drugs were later named antibiotics by Selman Waksman, an American microbiologist in 1942. The science and development of antibacterials as synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. Ehrlich noted that some dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, while others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind and kill the bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against different organisms, in 1907, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the synthetic antibacterial salvarsan now called arsphenamine.",What methods did people use to treat infections before antibiotics?,medicinal folklore,92,110

"To put it another way, a thing or person is often seen as having a ""defined essence"" or ""core identity"" that is immutable, and describes what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally identical over time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e. ""Mark's hair has turned gray because he He's grown older, but he's still the same person""). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existing things are separate ""occasions of experience"" that overlap each other in time and space, and jointly make up an enduring person or thing. On the other hand, common thinking often treats ""the essence of something"" or ""a person's identity/core"" as the most important or salient characteristics of that person or thing at a given time. One of its essence is generalization. Identities don't define people, people define identities.

"In higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine in what Whitehead terms ""symbolic reference"", linking appearance with reason in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals are able to avoid it. There is difficulty. By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. An ordinary person looks up, sees a colorful shape, and immediately assumes it is a chair. However, an artist, Whitehead believes, ""might not jump to the notion of a chair"", but instead might stop at ""the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and the contemplation of a beautiful shape."" There is no reaction; Most people place objects into categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Besides, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead explains that a dog ""will act immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and thus will have jumped through to use it."" Thus symbolic reference is a fusion of pure emotion perceptions on the one hand and On the other side are causal relations, and it is precisely the causal relations that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog shows), while it is the sense perceptions that point to a higher grade mentality (as the artist shows).",What is Whitehead's term for the two ways of combining perceptions?,symbolic reference,97,115

"Political anthropology is concerned with the structure of political systems, viewed from the basis of the structure of society. While political anthropology developed as a discipline primarily concerned with politics in stateless societies, a new development began from the 1960s, and is still manifesting: anthropologists increasingly turn to ""complex"" social settings to study In which the presence of states, bureaucracies, and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analyzes of local events. The turn towards complex societies meant that political issues were addressed at two main levels. At first, anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (in patron-client relationships or tribal political organization). Second, anthropologists gradually began to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and with the relationship between formal and informal political institutions).

Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar, and have been transferred to antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during evolution and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For example, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged through these resistance genes between different bacterial strains or species.

"In Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as ""quality"", ""matter"", and ""form"" are problematic. These fail to adequately account for change in ""classical"" concepts, and ignore the active and experiential nature of the world's most basic elements. They are useful abstractions, but not the basic building blocks of the world. What a person is usually conceived of, for example, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events. After all, people change all the time, if only because they are older than the second and have had some more experiences. These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but progressively linked in what Whitehead calls a ""society"" of events. By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists mistake the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the ""fallacy of misplaced objects"").",Whitehead calls experiences that are progressively linked?,Society,668,675
