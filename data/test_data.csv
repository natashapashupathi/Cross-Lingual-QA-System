"In physics, Whitehead's ideas have had some influence. He expressed a view that might perhaps be considered a form of Einstein's general relativity, see Whitehead's theory of gravitation. This has been seriously criticized. Yutaka Tanaka, who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings, proposes that Einstein's work does not actually refute Whitehead's formulation. Whitehead's view has now been rendered obsolete with the discovery of gravitational waves. Those phenomena have been observed locally that violate the local flatness of large-scale space that Whitehead assumes. As a result, Whitehead's universe should be treated as a local conjecture, and his notion of a similar spatio-temporal geometry, the Minkoloskian, should often be treated as a locally-sufficient conjecture.

"Antibacterial antibiotics are usually classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes. Those that target the bacterial cell wall (penicillins and cephalosporins) or cell membrane (polymyxins), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (rifamicins, lipiromycins, quinolones, and sulfonamides) have bactericidal activities. Those that target protein synthesis (macrolides, lincosamides, and tetracyclines) are generally bacteriostatic (with the exception of bactericidal aminoglycosides). Further classification is based on their target specificity. ""Narrow spectrum"" antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria, while broad spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria. After a 40-year hiatus in the discovery of new classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic lipopeptides (e.g. daptomycin), glycylcholines.

"In higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine in what Whitehead terms ""symbolic reference"", linking appearance with reason in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals are able to avoid it. There is difficulty. By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. An ordinary person looks up, sees a colorful shape, and immediately assumes it is a chair. However, an artist, Whitehead believes, ""might not jump to the notion of a chair"", but instead might stop at ""the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and the contemplation of a beautiful shape."" There is no reaction; Most people place objects into categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Besides, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead explains that a dog ""will act immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and thus will have jumped through to use it.""

For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar, and have been transferred to antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during evolution and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For example, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged through these resistance genes between different bacterial strains or species.

"Mahayana Buddhism received important theoretical grounding from Nagarjuna (probably c. 150–250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahayana tradition. Nāgārjuna's primary contribution to Buddhist philosophy was the systematic exposition of the concept of śśnyatā, or ""emptiness"", which was widely attested in the Prajñapāmita sutras that emerged in his era. The concept of emptiness brings together a rejection of other major Buddhist doctrines, particularly anatta and dependent origination, the metaphysics of Sarvottvāda and Sautrantika (extinct non-Mahayana school). For Nāgārjuna, it is not only sentient beings that are empty of āman; all phenomena (dharma) are without any sentient (literally ""self-nature"" or ""self-nature""), and thus without any inherent of essence; they are ""empty"" of independent being; thus the heterodox doctrines of the self circulating in time were rejected based on the principles of early Buddhism. Nagarjuna's school of thought is known as Dadhamaka. Some writings attributed to Nāgārjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts, but argued his philosophy within the parameters set by the Agamas. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the canon.

"Buddhist meditation basically deals with two topics: transforming the mind and using it to explore oneself and other phenomena. According to Theravada Buddhism the Buddha taught two types of meditation, Samatha meditation (Sanskrit: amadatha) and Vipassana meditation (Sanskrit: Vipaṇāya).

According to the Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism, in contrast, for most of Buddhist history before modern times, serious meditation by lay people has been uncommon.

"Comprehensive schools are primarily about providing an entitlement curriculum for all children, without selection being due to financial considerations or attainment. One result of this is a broader curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational education, which were less common or non-existent in grammar schools. 16 Providing education cost-effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools because of the comparatively smaller number of courses required to cover a comprehensive curriculum with fewer students. This is why schools have tended to grow larger and why many local authorities have organized secondary education into 11-16 schools, with 16 provision provided by sixth form colleges and further education colleges. Comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or merit, but there are demographic reasons why different schools have significantly different attainment profiles.

"Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of domestic dogs (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli. As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years BCE, dogs' brains have been essentially shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to our behavior. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the otherwise docile domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as the great apes.

"On the other hand, the change through the Phanerozoic fits much better with hyperbolic models (widely used in population biology, demography and macrosociology, as well as fossil biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter model implies that changes in diversity are guided by first order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or negative feedback resulting from resource limitation. The hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of world population growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between population size and the rate of technological progress. The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be equated to the feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between biodiversity and human population curves probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics.",Which model is widely used in macrosociology?,hyperbolic model,76,92
"Exposure to antibiotics early in life increases body mass in humans and mouse models. Early life is a critical period for the establishment of the intestinal microbiota and metabolic development. Mice exposed to the above antibiotic treatments (STAT) – either penicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and vancomycin, or chlortetracycline had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities. Additionally, research has shown that rats given low dose penicillin (1 μg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the lactation process had decreased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis. Expression was increased in control rats. Furthermore, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet rapidly increased insulin levels in rats. However, it is unclear whether antibiotics cause obesity in humans. Studies have found a correlation between early exposure to antibiotics (<6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months). Another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also important, with those macrolides having the highest risk of overweight compared to penicillins and cephalosporins. Therefore, there is an association between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans, but whether there is a causal relationship is unclear. Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans must weigh against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in childhood.",Do antibiotics cause obesity in humans?,unclear,832,839

"The digestive system of an earthworm consists of a mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like hands to grasp pieces of dead grass, leaves and weeds, helping to chew along bits of soil. Lips break food into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, food is lubricated by mucous secretions for easy passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acid formed by decaying foods. The crop consists of temporary storage where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When churning is complete, glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically break down the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue the chemical breakdown.

"Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar, and have been transferred to antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during evolution and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For example, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged through these resistance genes between different bacterial strains or species.

After all, people change all the time, if only because they are older than the second and have had some more experiences. These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but progressively linked in what Whitehead calls a ""society"" of events.

In some cases invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance. Others report evidence that sometimes suggests that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals.

Overall gamma diversity may be reduced as species become extinct for other reasons, but even some of the most inevitable invaders (E. : Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused extinction of their host species. Extinction, population decline, and homogenization of regional biodiversity are very common.
